    <!-- Scope is the context that code is excuted in
        
        wherever there is code, that code is running in a 
        specific context
        
        fuction doMath() {
        var x = 40;
        console.log(x)
        }
        
        Anytime you define a new function, it gets
        it's own new scope

        And it cna access variables that were defined
        outside it function, but inside the function, if
        we define something, it's not accessible outside
        the efunction
        -->

    <!-- Higher Order Functions
        We can pass functions to other functions??
        
        Set interval - repaet every second or half second-->
